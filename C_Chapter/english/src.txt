words like brutality break the silence   
come crashing in into my little world painful to me penetrate right through me   
can't you understand oh my little damsel   
all i ever wanted all i ever needed is here in my arms   
words are very futile they can only do harm   
vows are spoken to be crumbled feelings are intense words are unimportant   
pleasures stay so does the pain words are trivial and forgettable   
all i ever wanted all i ever needed is here in my arms words are very futile   
they can only do harm enjoy the silence
